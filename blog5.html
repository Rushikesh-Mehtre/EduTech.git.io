      <p class="Today-blog-head1">When strengths can backfire</p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        Right from a young age, Parul was commended for her fearlessness. When a
        fierce dog pounced on her, she barely flinched. When the van driver
        failed to show up, she put her group into an auto and dropped each one
        off before heading home herself. As a teenager, she would yell at sleazy
        men who tried to brush against her on the bus. Growing up, she kept
        hearing how plucky she was. But, as she entered adulthood, her courage
        wasn’t necessarily admirable. She zoomed around on a motorbike without a
        helmet, gave cutting rejoinders when her professors pulled her up for
        tardiness, and ignored any limits her parents tried to impose. Parul’s
        bravery had morphed into brazenness. Moderation matters Everyone has a
        unique constellation of character strengths. While one person may be
        persistent, creative and open-minded, another may be more forgiving,
        appreciative of beauty and humorous. In fact, positive psychology
        pioneers Chris Peterson and Martin Seligman have compiled a handbook of
        common character strengths and virtues valued across cultures the world
        over. While it is imperative that we identify and nurture our strengths,
        psychologists caution that we must exercise them in moderation, lest
        they turn into liabilities. In his book, Learned Hopefulness: The Power
        of Positivity to Overcome Depression, Dan Tomasulo argues that over- or
        under-using our strengths can spur interpersonal conflict and impede
        well-being. To reap their benefits, we must exercise our strengths
        judiciously. Too much of a good thing can actually turn out to be not
        such a good thing after all. So, a virtue like curiosity, which is
        essential for creativity and continual learning, can be recast as
        nosiness or intrusiveness if overdone. Similarly, a person who
        perseveres when the odds are against them has a greater likelihood of
        succeeding. However, if the person continues to exhibit tenacity, even
        when it is more prudent to change course, they are likely to remain in a
        rut. Thus, virtues can turn into impediments if they over-utilised.
        Bravery can transmogrify into recklessness, honesty into bluntness, a
        zest for life into hyperactivity and creativity into eccentricity. So,
        we need to strike a balance to ensure that we are utilising our
        strengths optimally. Even if we are good at something, overextending
        ourselves can hurt us. Whenever we deploy our strengths, we have to be
        sensitive to contextual aspects so that our strengths help a situation
        as opposed to harming it. In their book, Practical Wisdom: The Right Way
        to Do the Right Thing, psychologists Barry Schwartz and Kenneth Sharpe
        point out that many situations in life involve balancing conflicting
        aims. For example, doctors are obligated to divulge the truth about a
        patient’s diagnosis. But everyone is more comfortable with a humane
        doctor who is able to convey hope even in the face of despair. Thus,
        doctors have to balance the competing aims of honesty and compassion. A
        doctor who is forthright may have to cultivate the art of conveying
        information sensitively, whereas a more compassionate doctor may have to
        curb a tendency to hedge when communicating bad news. Understanding our
        individual cocktail of strengths and weaknesses and the peculiarities of
        different situations enables us to be better doctors, lawyers, teachers,
        colleagues, peers, parents or partners. In How to Change: The Science of
        Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be, behavioural
        scientist Katy Milkman describes how tennis legend Andre Agassi had to
        recalibrate his strengths in order to rebound from a dispiriting career
        slump. Though he made his debut in professional tennis at age 16 to much
        acclaim, within a decade, he reached the nadir of his career. Brad
        Gilbert, who had studied Agassi’s poor performance and agreed to coach
        him, told the star that he was squandering his talents by overusing
        them. That Agassi was trying to “hit a winner on every ball” was
        actually his undoing. Because he was failing to meet his own unrealistic
        expectations time and again, his confidence was ebbing. Only then did
        Agassi realise that his perfectionist streak, which he believed to be an
        asset, was actually hampering his performance. Gilbert then advised
        Agassi to focus on his opponent’s weaknesses instead of his own self.
        When he stopped playing to what he had perceived were his strengths,
        Agassi’s career graph spiked again. While you may foster your talents
        and nourish your gifts, remember to wield them sagaciously, being
        mindful of contextual forces, so that they work for as opposed to
        against you.
