        Meet the real power players: on alternate career paths for college
        students in 2020
      </p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        ‘What a show off!’ I smirked, as I watched the US presidential debate,
        ‘Just because he’s in power!’ Of the current president or the ex-VP?
        Nah, of the man who wagged his finger at both. The moderator, Chris
        Wallace, treated the potential leaders of the country like
        tantrum-throwing kindergartners, doling out their two minutes, snipping
        them off mid-sentence, rapping their knuckles for interrupting. People
        in power! You’ve met enough who’ve made you squirm. Often literally. If
        you’ve shared a bathroom with someone who reads a 600-page novel in
        there, or at times you suspect is writing one, you’ll know what I mean.
        You’ve twisted your legs together, held your breath and bladder, whined
        and wheedled, but it falls on deaf ears of he who squats on the throne
        within. High on the list of mega manipulators is the doctor’s assistant.
        Not the one who holds a needle to your arm (he’s scary enough), but the
        one who sits outside, yawning, yakking on the phone, and sending
        everyone, but you, in. ‘But I got here before them,’ you will have
        pleaded at least thrice in an hour. ‘Sorry, earlier appointment,’ the
        assistant smiles at you or ‘Babies first’ or ‘Serious emergency’ while
        waving in an old man who’d fallen asleep, exhibiting neither baby nor
        emergency. The next time, you book the earliest appointment, haul in
        your cousin-in-law’s protesting baby and claim breathless agony. ‘Sorry,
        doctor had to leave,’ says this person in power, ‘personal engagement.’
        What of the guy who checks your papers? For the driving licence,
        application, visa, loan, claim. You know he’s always going to reject you
        for something you’ve forgotten. And, of course, you can’t send it by
        mail; you need to bring it in person and spend another four hours in the
        queue to reach the counter just as the ‘Out for Lunch’ sign goes up
        Plumbers whom you’d pay an arm and a leg to because your toilet keeps
        regurgitating. Tailors who have no time to finish the sari blouse before
        the wedding. Auto drivers who refuse to go anywhere on the rainiest day
        of the week. Power players, all. This power game starts early. When
        you’re a toddler, you’re tossed into it. The lower the class, the higher
        the power its teacher wields. ‘If you don’t, I will tell your mother,’
        she frowns while your mother resorts to ‘If you don’t, I will tell your
        teacher.’ Either way, you’re toast, you realise young enough. And so,
        since college admissions are around the corner, here’s a list of
        power-careers for your child who deserves the best: Man Friday.
        Gate-man. Paper-pusher. Eyebrow-plucker. And that unassailable power
        puff who answers the door to say, ‘Madam’s not at home’. ‘Please,
        please, just five minutes,’ you beg, ‘I just saw her, let me only...’
        ‘Sorry, what is your name again?’ Power puff shrugs. ‘Yes, Madam said to
        tell you she’s pukka not at home.’
