      <p class="Today-blog-head1">‘Communication is an underrated skill’</p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        Ever wondered why CEOs, leaders and recruiters talk endlessly about soft
        skills? Find out in Skill It, Kill It, a new book in which entrepreneur
        Ronnie Screwvala shares personal stories and observations from his
        failures and successes, to give you an insider’s view of the ‘invisible’
        skills that can cut years off your learning curve. Excerpts from an
        interview: I am an accidental author. The inspiration for this book
        stemmed from the interactions with learners. I think lifelong learning
        is an integral element for growth in this era’s hyper-competitive
        environment. Today, to make a mark, you need to have a strong element of
        focus. If you want to be in the top 20-25 percentile of your
        organisation, you have to come out of your comfort zone, upgrade again,
        specialise and continue this cycle till you have achieved your goal.
        While talking to students, I saw a serious gap in their soft skills. Now
        while ‘skill’ means lots of things to a lot of people, it cannot be
        restricted to a degree, diploma or even certifications. I believe that
        equipping yourself with the right communication skills is important and,
        without it, people are often left behind, despite having the right hard
        skills for the job. What skills do students need today? It is important
        for students to realise the importance of soft skills in their formative
        years. Through school, we tend to focus on our grades and rank and do
        not invest any effort in acquiring soft skills like communicating
        effectively or inculcating the art of storytelling. Communication is a
        severely underrated skill, especially in this digital remote work era.
        Most people assume that communication is tethered on oratory skills or
        command of the language. Actually it is so many things, including
        listening, absorbing and knowing when to stop. If you acquire the art of
        communicating through storytelling, you will be able to influence and
        impact people by shaping their minds. Stories help us connect with the
        audience and foster empathy. Storytelling is a lifelong skill that ought
        to be honed. All your chapters have anecdotes and advice from well-known
        personalities. Why do you think these will work as motivators for
        students? I wrote it thinking about what I would have needed when I was
        young. Throughout the book, I allude to similar experiences from various
        personalities and leaders to develop that sense of connectedness for the
        reader. My hope is that people will realise the importance of being
        focused and the power of self- conviction. You’ve coined some new words.
        Tell us about the new LOL. This comes from my own experience as a young
        professional. I would be so excited about putting a point across that I
        would not allow the person before me to finish what he/she was saying.
        Not only was it rude but also wrong. Listening is a skill I have worked
        very hard to improve through my career. It requires focused thoughts,
        attention to detail, feedback, and the ability to absorb what another
        person is speaking in order to decode what they are really saying. So,
        for me Listen, Observe, Learn is the new LOL. To truly listen and then
        act on feedback from others will help us avoid repeating mistakes and
        accelerate professional growth and change. Moreover, even great ideas
        and teams can be aligned if you follow the new LOL. Why is upgrading and
        future-proofing one’s career important? This is where the concept of
        Lifelong Learning comes into play. If you were to believe that your
        greatest learning and greatest failure are yet to transpire, then you
        are allowing yourself to keep an open mind. This, in turn, opens your
        mind to learning and upgrading your skills because it reminds you that
        you have still got so much to learn. Why do you debunk the idea of
        multitasking and emphasise the importance of saying no? My dog taught me
        that multitasking is overrated and often counterproductive! To put it
        simply, multitasking leads to distraction, which leads to all kinds of
        hazards. Multitasking fosters the habit of distraction from the task at
        hand, leads to a decline in the quality of your work, and to an eventual
        decline in productivity overall. Eventually it leads to feeling
        overwhelmed and disconnected on a daily basis. The need to be social is
        a skill that requires a lot of discretion. How much is too much? My
        advice would be to keep an open mind and network wherever possible
        because every piece of communication has the capability of triggering a
        thought that could catapult your career.
