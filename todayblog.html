      <p class="Today-blog-head1">“Productivity” in COVID times</p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        A couple of weeks ago, I received a forward which read “If you don’t
        come out of this quarantine with either a new skill, your side hustle
        started, or more knowledge gained, then you never lacked the time. You
        lacked discipline”. How do you feel when you read a message like that?
        Do you feel motivated, ready to sign up for those online courses you
        have been meaning to take, or pick up that book you have been meaning to
        read? Or do you feel guilty that a few weeks of lockdown have gone by
        and you haven’t “accomplished” enough? While it’s nice to say that “We
        are all in this together”, the truth is each of us is going through
        something different during this lockdown period, and it isn’t something
        we can generalise into a common experience. Some of us can take for
        granted that we can maintain social distancing with our own personal
        space. Others may not be able to. Some of us are left bereft of work,
        while others are working harder than ever. Some of us may have the
        support of family and friends, while the rest are trying to get by on
        their own. Need to cope This is not an extended summer holiday harking
        back to our school days. It’s a time of stress. An unprecedented event
        that most of us are experiencing for the first time. The same “rules”
        that applied to our lives in the pre-COVID era need not necessarily
        apply today. Just like governments and economies are adapting to the new
        situation and designing new ways of working, so too should our societal
        norms and beliefs. In this context, the pressure we typically feel to be
        constantly productive and have something to show for our free time could
        be hurting us, rather than helping. Each of us cope differently when
        faced with stressful experiences. Some people may take a little longer
        to bounce back than others, and that is completely okay! It is important
        to acknowledge and accept the mental roadblocks you may be facing when
        you’re trying to develop knowledge, a new skill, or build up a hobby.
        Focus on learning how to manage these blocks first. Seek professional
        help through online counselling if you need to, rather than shaming
        yourself for “wasting” time so far. (In fact, that’s another societal
        belief to overturn now, more than ever: getting help for mental health
        is perfectly normal, not taboo!) This lockdown isn’t some sort of divine
        test of your productivity. If you have opted to focus on your own or
        your family’s wellbeing and just want to emerge from this period as a
        healthy and happy individual, that is a great goal! It doesn’t matter
        how you have spent your time or whether you have added extra lines of
        accomplishments to your CV. What if your goal was, in fact, similar to
        what the forward at the beginning of this article promoted? To learn new
        skills, gain knowledge or start up side businesses? In that case, you
        will be more successful when you are genuinely interested in and
        energised by these activities, rather than when you are driven to doing
        them out of fear or guilt. In many of our cities, the lockdown may be
        extended for a longer period. You may have to be in this state for the
        foreseeable future. So remember, be kind to yourself and do what appeals
        to you and what feels right to you, not what you think society expects
        you to do.
