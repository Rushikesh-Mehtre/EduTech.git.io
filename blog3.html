        Lack of uniformity in awarding marks to students by schools: teachers’
        organisations
      </p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        Several school teachers’ organisations in West Bengal have said that
        lack of uniformity in awarding marks by schools in Class 9 examination
        led to a majority of students securing higher marks in the Madhayamik
        (Class 10) examination. More than 90% of the students secured first
        division marks in this year’s Madhyamik examination and the pass
        percentage was a record one hundred per cent. The Madhyamik examination
        could not be held this year due to the pandemic situation and the
        evaluation was based on the candidate’s performance in the 2019 class
        examination in Class 9 and internal assessment for every subject in
        Class 10 on a 50:50 basis. The teacher’s organisations also voiced
        concern that with so many students securing high marks and the pass
        percentage one hundred% there are more pass outs than Class 11 seats.
        There is reason to believe that many schools were not strict in awarding
        Class 9 exam marks to the students and the West Bengal Board of
        Secondary Education could do little in such situations as they had to go
        by the marks sent by the schools, All Bengal Post Graduate Teachers
        Welfare Association office-bearer Chandan Garai told PTI on July 21.
        “Many schools are not that tough in screening students when they are
        promoted to Class 9. The screening becomes tougher in Class 10. When the
        board announced 50:50 ratio in good faith giving equal weightage to
        Class 9 annual exam number and subject wise internal assessment in Class
        10, we had this fear about each candidate getting numbers not
        commensurate to their ability and that came to be true,” Mr. Garai said.
        He said the emerging situation will lead to lesser number of seats in
        higher secondary institutions as over 10 lakh students have passed with
        over 9 lakh getting first division and the students with less merit will
        benefit. “Also a large number of students will try to enroll themselves
        in science subjects as they have got 70-80% marks though they would have
        deserved not more than 40-45%. What would these students do after opting
        for science,” he wondered. Senior teacher and office-bearer of Paschim
        Bango Sikshak Samity, Naba Kumar Karmakar said around 35,000 students in
        city and over 10 lakh in the State would not have much problem to get a
        seat in a higher secondary school but the meritorious ones may not get a
        school of their choice. “Hence we would ask the higher secondary schools
        to conduct an entrance test for the students, at least for science
        streams, so that there is a proper evaluation and the deserving ones are
        not deprived,” the senior teacher said. He said 35,000 students in city
        won’t face a problem to find a seat in Class 11 but again getting the
        right institution will be. “Also of the 10,79,749 candidates, the number
        of girls was fairly higher than boys this time. Hence all the girl
        students may find problem in getting berths in schools many of which are
        for boys only and several coeducational as well,” he said. Both said it
        was doubtful if the candidates would like to sit for offline exams now
        as suggested by Board once the COVID-19 situation improved. Tarun Naskar
        said, on behalf of All Bengal Save Education Committee “we had thought
        the pass percentage could be 100% going by the 50:50% evaluation
        methodology of the Board. This led to many candidates not getting their
        favourite subjects while meritorious students will suffer.”
