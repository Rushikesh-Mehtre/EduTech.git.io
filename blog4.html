        Cognitive skills occupy a vital role in an individual’s overall
        development, as they include some of the brain’s core functions such as
        thinking, reading, learning, retaining information, and paying attention
        and are used to solve problems, remember tasks and make decisions. All
        this affects the quality of our learning and performance. One of the
        most important cognitive skills is attention, which enables us to
        process the necessary information from our environment. We usually
        process such information through our senses, stored memories, and other
        cognitive processes. Lack of attention inhibits and reduces our
        information processing systems. Inter-related skills Memory is another
        cognitive skill that allows information recall — a student remembers the
        main points of the previous week’s Science class, assuming that he/she
        paid attention to the information in the first place. Thus, cognitive
        skills are inter-related. People’s long-term memory is only effective if
        they are paying attention to a subject, and store the information in
        their short-term memory, also known as working memory. Other cognitive
        skills include logic and reasoning, which help us to generate ideas and
        solve problems by analysing, deducing necessary information and
        understanding them. This also requires auditory processing, which means
        our brains blend, analyse, and segment information we have heard or
        listened to. This cognitive skill helps students to listen and interpret
        the information received. Strong visual processing skills allow us to
        formulate designs and make sense of graphs and tables. Processing speed
        helps us perform tasks quickly and accurately. This also becomes faster
        with the right understanding of the subject matter. Why they are
        essential Thus, cognitive skills are mental capabilities that are vital
        for students to learn effectively. They complement each other to
        function effectively and determine the success of learning outcomes. As
        most learning challenges are caused by inadequate cognitive skills, it
        is necessary to question how we are enabling our future leaders to grow
        and what tools we can provide for their growth. Schools can start
        focusing on developing students’ cognitive skills through
        age-appropriate physical activities and brain exercises. Research has
        established that certain chemicals released during exercise stimulate
        neural connections and brain growth. In addition, they can try to
        enhance children’s creativity and curiosity by exposing them to art,
        music, crafts, Sudoku, crosswords, and more. This can significantly
        influence logic and reasoning skills. Another important activity is
        interaction with the natural world around them so that they are in tune
        with it.
